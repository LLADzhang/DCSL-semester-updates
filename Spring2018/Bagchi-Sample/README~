In the README file, say first the high level things about the repo and then some details about how to get the code to run.

High level things:
1 or 2 paragraphs about what the repo accomplishes. If there is a paper or a submission that goes with this repo, mention that here.

Low level things:
This is a typical README that goes into a source distribution. 
* What are the dependencies? 
* What are the steps needed to get this code to run? 
* What are the sample evaluation scripts? 
* What will the output file look like?
